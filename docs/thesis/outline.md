Master Thesis Outline
=====================

This document intends to be an outline of my master thesis.


Outline
-------

1. Introduction

    1. Background
        * Why is this thesis important?
            - Part of a larger project to improve channel selection in WiFi
        
    2. Scope
        * What is the main question I'm trying to answer?
            - How do you scan a network from an AP without affecting the
              performance of the connected STAs?
        * How does this help the main project?
            - Helps with finding other access points so the algorithm can do
              its work with calculating channel selection.
    
    3. Existing research and current practices
        * What existing research has been about this particular problem?
            - There has not been done a lot of research directly about scanning
              the network as an AP
            - A lot of research has been done on how scanning works and its
              impact on the individual client and the rest of the network
            - There has also been a lot of research into improving the impact
              and performance of scanning in WiFi deployments.
        * What is the current way scanning is done in WiFi networks?
            - Mainly from clients
            - NOTE: Maybe worth checking out how APs scan the network to do
                    their own channel selection?
        * What are the problems with active scanning and passive scanning
          according to existing research?
            - Active scanning creates latency
            - Passive scanning is slow
    
2. Method

    * How did I get the results?
        - Show code that was used
        - If any libraries were used for the code, why?
        - How did I get the data? Real-world measurements or simulations?
    * What did I _not_ do during my research?

3. Results

    * Present my findings
    * Organize, classify and analyze the data
    * Interpret and explain the findings.
    * Are these findings in line with what I expected from the work I talked
      about in the introduction?

4. Discussion

    * How does these findings relate to the main project?
        - What are the practical implications of these findings for the project?
        - Make recommendations related to the project
    * How does these findings compare to previous work in the field?
        - Do they reflect on what previous studies have said? Why or why not?
    * Is more research needed to give a definitive answer?

5. Conclusion

6. Further Work
