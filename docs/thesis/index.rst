Using ResFi for distributed discovery of a local wireless network
=================================================================

In this thesis, I intend to take a look at a subsection of a larger project
addressing interference in 802.11 wireless networks :cite:`IEEE802.11`. This
project tries to solve the problem with a decentralized algorithm where every
access point in a given neighborhood discovers each other and communicates
over back haul. The algorithm will assign a channel, and antenna power output,
to each access point, to minimize interference.

What this thesis aims to solve is scanning the local area for active
wireless nodes, so that the algorithm can do it's work.
