Scope
-----

In this section I'll be discussing whats is and what is not in the scope of
this thesis. The goal, as discussed in the introduction, is to find a way to
give the channel allocation all the information it needs to select the best
channel for a given access point.


What am I trying to figure out?
-------------------------------

At a glance it would seem rather simple to find other access points in a
network with a simple scan, but this might not be the case. The implementation
will have to keep network performance and discovery accuracy in mind.

The definition of this thesis is thus:

**How do you scan a network from an AP without affecting the performance of
the connected STAs while still ensuring accurate resultes?**


How does this aid the main project?

    Write this section!


Outside of the scope
--------------------

.. todo::

    Not quite sure if this is a section I actually should have?


The following is not in the scope of this thesis.

Hardware-spesific solutions
###########################

.. todo::

    Cite some article that has a hardware specific solution?

Hardware-specific solutions will not be looked into in this article, as the
aim is to use existing infrastructure and equipment to implement the algorithm.
In addition to this, hardware spesific solutions will be more costly for vendors
and can thus be unfavorable.
