    abstract = {<p>It is obvious that a seamless handoff should be pursued for better service. For this reason, we design a novel and feasible 802.11 handoff scheme for 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). In the proposed handoff scheme, the 802.11 access points (APs) have multiple radios. One of the multiple radios is exclusively reserved for scanning purposes. It certainly helps the 802.11 mobile stations (STAs) to easily search neighboring APs. Moreover, the reserved exclusive channel is available for data frame exchanges. Consequently, STAs can be serviced with minimized data frame losses while they are performing the proposed handoff. For practical observations, we implement the proposed handoff scheme. Then, we evaluate handoff performances by comparing the packet losses between the proposed handoff scheme and the existing handoff schemes. Based on the evaluation, we have built analytical models to estimate overall packet losses while an STA moves from an AP to another AP in an indoor environment. The analytical results show that the proposed handoff significantly reduces packet losses compared with existing 802.11 handoff schemes.</p>},

    issn = {2166-9570},
    abstract = {<p>In this paper, we study the IEEE 802.11 discovery process needed for handovers and propose an adaptive scanning strategy based on application requirements. The scanning process consists in actively probing the radio channels to gather access points information. We consider a well decoupled situation in which the scanning latency, the scanning failure rate and the number of discovered access points define the scanning performance. We model these scanning metrics by analytical expressions to represent the performance trade-off, i.e., finding the largest number of access points with a minimum latency. We present a novel approach based on a multi-objective optimization approach to obtain the optimal number of channels to scan, the optimal channel sequence and its correspondent scanning timers. Finally, we compare one fixed and two adaptive scanning approaches by means of simulations. We show that our adaptive scanning strategies better manage the performance trade-off and allow different application profiles to match with specific scanning latency.</p>},

@inproceedings{ProactiveScan,
    issn = {0743166X},
    abstract = {<p>It has been a challenging problem to support VoIP-type delay sensitive applications in an 802.11 wireless LAN, because the standard handoff procedure implemented in many current 802.11 products occurs a delay deem unacceptable to VoIP users. To reduce this delay, we have developed a fast handoff scheme called Proactive Scan. It employs two new techniques. The first is to decouple the time-consuming channel scan from the actual handoff, and to eliminate channel scan delay by doing scan early and interleaving it with ongoing traffic in a non-intrusive way. The second technique is a smart trigger that takes into account both uplink and downlink quality and explicitly addresses the link asymmetry which has yet not been touched in previous work. Through implementation and experimentation study, we have shown that Proactive Scan does provide fast handoff and satisfactory performance to VoIP applications. Further, it is a software-only client-only solution that any mobile device can use in any existing 802.11 networks.</p>},

@inproceedings{PracticalSchemes,
    abstract = {<p>The limited service range of the access points demands mobile wireless stations to handoff frequently between different cells in the IEEE 802.11 infrastructure networks. However, the handoff scheme used in the current 802.11 infrastructure networks is far from graceful. In this paper, we propose a smooth MAC layer handoff scheme and a greedy smooth MAC layer handoff scheme. Our schemes scan channels in a smooth manner so that the handoff can have less impact on upper layer applications. In order to limit the frequency of channel scanning, an adaptive mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the threshold triggering the channel scanning operations. We have implemented our handoff schemes using commodity 802.11 devices and extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our schemes reduce packet delay and loss during handoff. Our handoff schemes are implemented in the client side only and do not require changes to access points. Therefore, our schemes can be deployed in the existing 802.11 networks</p>},

  abstract={This paper presents a study of mobile wireless LAN (WLAN) hotspots which are used to provide cellular-WiFi tethering service to personal devices. A dense deployment scenario for fixed and mobile WLAN is described and potential performance problems due to interference are identified. An analytical model for coexisting fixed and mobile WLAN hotspots with heterogeneous traffic is presented. The model is used to evaluate the performance of a mobile WLAN as it transits through a set of densely deployed fixed access points (APs), and performance problems due to lack of frequency coordination are identified. An adaptive channel assignment (ACA) scheme for improving mobile AP performance is proposed and evaluated. It is shown that significant performance gains can be achieved with ACA with maximum absolute and percentage throughput gains up to 1.24 Mbps and 42.8% respectively. We also show that setting the scanning interval in ACA requires consideration of the speed at which the mobile WLAN is moving in order to compensate for the throughput losses during channel scanning.},
