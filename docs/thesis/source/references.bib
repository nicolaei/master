    abstract = {<p>It is obvious that a seamless handoff should be pursued for better service. For this reason, we design a novel and feasible 802.11 handoff scheme for 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs). In the proposed handoff scheme, the 802.11 access points (APs) have multiple radios. One of the multiple radios is exclusively reserved for scanning purposes. It certainly helps the 802.11 mobile stations (STAs) to easily search neighboring APs. Moreover, the reserved exclusive channel is available for data frame exchanges. Consequently, STAs can be serviced with minimized data frame losses while they are performing the proposed handoff. For practical observations, we implement the proposed handoff scheme. Then, we evaluate handoff performances by comparing the packet losses between the proposed handoff scheme and the existing handoff schemes. Based on the evaluation, we have built analytical models to estimate overall packet losses while an STA moves from an AP to another AP in an indoor environment. The analytical results show that the proposed handoff significantly reduces packet losses compared with existing 802.11 handoff schemes.</p>},

@inproceedings{SelectingScanningParameters,
    issn = {2166-9570},
    abstract = {<p>In this paper, we study the IEEE 802.11 discovery process needed for handovers and propose an adaptive scanning strategy based on application requirements. The scanning process consists in actively probing the radio channels to gather access points information. We consider a well decoupled situation in which the scanning latency, the scanning failure rate and the number of discovered access points define the scanning performance. We model these scanning metrics by analytical expressions to represent the performance trade-off, i.e., finding the largest number of access points with a minimum latency. We present a novel approach based on a multi-objective optimization approach to obtain the optimal number of channels to scan, the optimal channel sequence and its correspondent scanning timers. Finally, we compare one fixed and two adaptive scanning approaches by means of simulations. We show that our adaptive scanning strategies better manage the performance trade-off and allow different application profiles to match with specific scanning latency.</p>},
